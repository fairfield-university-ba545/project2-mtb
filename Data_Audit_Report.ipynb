    "<b> Key-Takeaways </b>\n",
    " - There are no null values in our dataset, although additional cross-validation tests have to be performed in the imputation phase\n",
    " - recoding of the following text features are needed: _Month_, _VisitorType_\n",
    " - recoding of categorical features is needed (>5 categories)\n",
    " - target variable _'Revenue'_ is imbalanced: 84.53% did not have a transaction after a visit.\n",
    "     <br> In the modeling phase our training set has to be over- or undersampled\n",
    " - all features seem to be highly skewed and normalization is necessary in the data preparation phase.\n",
    " - There are a lot of outliers for our features, they need to be delt with in the preparation phase. \n",
    " - 4 features are highly correlated with another feature in the dataset, especially BounceRates with ExitRates.\n",
    "    <br> Either these features need to be combined or 1 of the pairwise correlated features should not be included in the modeling phase.\n",
    " - Most visitors are returning visitors versus new visitor on a webpage\n",
    " - Most visitors are from the same region\n",
    " - Most visitors use the same webbrowser\n",
    " - The more (Administrative, Informational) webpages visited in a session the longer the duration\n",
    " - There are 3 dominant Operating Systems that visitors employ\n",
    " - Most visits were in the months: May, November\n",
    " - Most visits were not close to a Special Day\n",
    " - Our target variable is binary, our models employed should be compatible in the modeling phase\n",
    " - ExitRates and BounceRates are much smaller for visitors that made a transaction\n",
    " - ProductRelated_Duration is much smaller for visitors that made a transaction "
